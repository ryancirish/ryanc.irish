			<p>Virgil Abloh is one of my favorite creatives and it has been amazing to see his rise from humble underground beginnings to the creation of a contemporary fashion giant, among other ventures. Always humble, always reaching back to help the next generation through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biFlrzTJets">speaking</a> or personal contact. In his latest lecture given (see above link), he emphasizes creating a visual language and a mentality of free creation and anti-perfectionism. In order to create all that I seek I must not only hone my desired ventures in the moment, but also understand that some of these feats will come from compounding "interest" at a later time. Rome was not built in a day.</p>

			<p>Half the battle for some is developing the proper framework to use as a springboard for continued, consistent success. I definitely recommend Cal Newport and the book <i>Daily Habits</i>, which delves into the tendencies and patterns of famous artists and authors. Overall, if someone were to do one thing that can serve as a boost to the holistic "interest", it would be mindfulness. Medititaion may be the cure to the digitized hyperspeed that we all immerse ourselves in daily. </p>

			<p>Until next time</p>
